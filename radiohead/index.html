Though the exact timeframe it was worked on remains unknown, it is safe to assume that it was created sometime in the latter half of the album's production. lyrics for the supposed song showed up on Radiohead\u2019s page: \"dogwander* bring on another take better than another cake.\" Because songs released on OKC were also on the page, which had asterisks (*) in front of them followed by their respective lyrics, many had considered this line proof of the song's existence. For a long period of time it was falsely believed that the song was played during a soundcheck for the MTV Spot show on December 19th, 1997, as a result of its lyrics mentioning licking up wounds (perhaps like a dog), and baking a cake (similarly to the alleged lyric on the Radiohead webpage). Dogwander\u2019s alternate name was likely The National Anthem, as a lyric page which featured the songs alternate title was found paired with Dogwander. This conclusion has been reached because The National Anthem was still called Everyone during OKC's production. Dogwander was not included on the leaked OK Computer minidiscs (but a recording of a TV show that mentions the song did), nor was it included on OKNOTOK. On November 19th, 2024, a compilation of songs from OK Computer sessions leaked. One of these songs, titled \"Get Around\" had the lyrics \"bring on another take better than another cake,\" meaning that this is, in fact, dogwander.
