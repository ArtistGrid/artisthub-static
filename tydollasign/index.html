                            Hurricane [V16](ref. 070 Shake) (feat. Ty Dolla $ign) (prod. BoogzDaBeast, Nascent & RONNY J)(Don't Let Me Down, Hurricanes, 80 Degrees)
                            <div class="song-description">OG Filename: Hurricane 8.28.18 Shake Vocals Filedate says it was recorded 8.28.18, however this doesn't really make sense with "Hurricane's" evolution, so it's safe to assume this was a misspelling of 9.28.18. It's confirmed that 070 Shake does part of the hook, but any other info about this version is unknown. Stems are confirmed to be owned by members of the community. Snippet of Shake's vocal take leaked February 22nd, 2025. Longer snippet of the full track leaked February 23rd, 2025, showing it includes Ty's infamous "grandma couch" verse.</div>

Gunna has been taken off this version, similar to WE NEED ALL DA VIBES. OG file later leaked, confirming that this version is from 2025 and intended for TYCOON .</div>
