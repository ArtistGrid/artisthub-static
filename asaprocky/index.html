During the start of the preview, Rocky says the new title of the song, mentioning it is also known as \"Old Jim Jones\". The song features revamped production and a new intro, using the sample \"Give Love a Try\" by Leroy Hutson which is also used throughout the track. An unheard feature is provided by Florida rapper BossMan Dlow, with any signs of Yoshi24k's contributions to the song not being heard. The track also removes a verse from a song, the one in which was heard in the original 2023 snippets, which is how the song became wanted by the community in the first place, and it is currently unknown why it was removed. During the performance, Rocky lifts up his shirt to reveal another shirt with a big stop sign as well as saying \"STOP SNITCHIN\", which is referenced in the song when he says \"bout to buy a stop sign shirt to stop the snitchin\", with the obvious intention as a diss towards people snitching in general as well as former A$AP Mob member Relli. The two went to trial with due to a November 2021 altercation where Rocky was accused of shooting Relli during an argument in Hollywood, with Rocky being found not guilty on all charges three years later. The general consensus of the trial is that Relli's motive was to get money from Rocky as he would often lie about the altercation during his testimony, meaning Relli was 'snitching', in this case, for money.", "file_id": "d8344bc6c4b53a46646fadc1dfd63b24", "stream_url": "https://api.pillows.su/api/download/d8344bc6c4b53a46646fadc1dfd63b24", "download_url": "https://api.pillows.su/api/download/d8344bc6c4b53a46646fadc1dfd63b24", "cover": "https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/sheets/APBGjhadnt8hPKoqHj4DFSFzmqrMC7_oUrdos8sBnwUtYCSasIUMO5BAiZ3sII1QOgwxtUR6-lsDiWwLdcH3G6BgJAILOwA75btrP-tmRWoNB7TOr1kMvL-534C28wAuFFus85uaiEFuk4Nq0GKH=w170-h169"}, {"era": "DON'T BE DUMB [V3]", "name": "SWAT [V3](prod.
