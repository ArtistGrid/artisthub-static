A good chunk of the song was posted to YouTube in low quality by a random youtube channel called "Wrld Of Leaks" on May 27, 2024, which could be the full song, but it cuts very strangely, loops towards the start, and is five seconds shorter than the real song supposedly is, so it probably isn't. A lossless snippet is also leaked, although it is tagged. Was seemingly leaked in full on leaked.cx, but much like Snapchat, it has since been taken down.</div>
